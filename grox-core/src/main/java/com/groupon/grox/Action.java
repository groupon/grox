 * Like Redux actions, actions in grox are:

 * <ul>
 *   <li>responsible for changing the state
 *   <li>they only produce a new state out of an old state. State being immutable.
 *   <li>they are pure functions, have no side effects, have no dependencies that are not pure. They
 *       are fully reproducible.
 *   <li>they are fully testable.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Typically, an action is a state less object, has no dependencies and is tested.
 *
 * @param <STATE> the class of the state.
